I have many places to capture my posts.  [tumblr](http://makzan.tumblr.com) for life events. [makzan.net](http://makzan.net) for personal website. So what is the github page for?

I think I can make here the journal for [my open source code](https://github.com/makzan)? I'm very new to open source world. But what if I contribute more to the open source world. At the same time I record the journal here? May be. Who knows if I will abandon logging here soon.
